# Text Extraction from Images

This project demonstrates how to use EasyOCR, OpenCV, and Matplotlib to perform Optical Character Recognition (OCR) on images and extract text. The extracted text is saved to a file, and bounding boxes are drawn around the detected text in the image for visualization.

## Requirements
Python 

EasyOCR

OpenCV

Matplotlib
## Installation
To install the necessary libraries, run the following commands:

## bash
    pip install easyocr
    pip install opencv-python
    pip install matplotlib

## Usage
Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.

Place the image you want to process in the project directory.

Update the image_path variable in the script with the path to your image file.

## Run the script:

bash
Copy code
python text_extraction.py
Example Code
Here's the complete code for text extraction:

python
Copy code
### Import Libraries
    import easyocr

    import cv2

    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

### Initialize EasyOCR reader
    reader = easyocr.Reader(['en'])

### Load image
    image_path = "p5.jpeg" # Provide path to image
    image = cv2.imread(image_path)

### Perform OCR on the image
    result = reader.readtext(image)


### Draw bounding boxes and display the results
    for (bbox, text, prob) in result:
                cv2.FONT_HERSHEY_SIMPLEX, 0.9, (0, 255, 0), 2)

### Display the image with bounding boxes
    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 10))
    plt.imshow(cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB))
    plt.axis('off')
    plt.show()

    print(f"Extracted text has been saved to {output_file}")
# For Complete Code Please See TextExt.py

## Output
The extracted text will be saved to a file named out1.txt. The script will also display the image with bounding boxes around the detected text.
